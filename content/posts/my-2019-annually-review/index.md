Goodbye 2019 - end of a decade, a big year to me. Just like other previous years, I have free time to look back what I have done over past 12 months.
The only one different thing is that I gonna publish a blog post instead of using paper and my mind like before.

## 1. What went well this year?

**Building up [Hubble](https://hubble.sg) Saigon team.** Early of 2019, I took remote contract job at [90seconds](https://90seconds.com/) after left [honestbee](https://honestbee.sg) (I leant a lot and met a lot of super stars from that company). Remote working gives me more flexibilities. I have more times with my family, more coffee times (cups and shops). But few months later, I felt missing somethings: startup spirit, working with a team. I want to contribute more and take more responsibilities as well. Luckily, [@SJ](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/shijinglin) contacted, flew down to Saigon and asked me to build Saigon team. It's such a good moment. I am learning a lot across fields: _hiring_, _administration_, _management_, _leadership_.

**My daughter.** Thank you my parents-in-law for supporting us on taking care of #nhim (our daughter). And a big shout out to my wife for bringing #nhim to the world, growing up with her. We're on track on that part. Now she knows and can speak a lot of words both in English and Vietnamese.

**Mindset.** Startup spirit, curiosity, process-oriented help me learn and grow fast.

**Supporting our parents.** At the end of the day, beside yourself, your family is the most important. We totally agree on that. Hence, we would love to support a little bit finance for our parents to improve their living conditions.

**Finance.** We have better income and better savings, yay.

## 2. What didn't go so well this year?

**Health.** I was failed to keep the discipline on getting up early, running every morning. I usually go to bed late until I clear my works. It affects my family's wake up time, breakfast time also.

**Staying in touch with parents, relatives and friends.** I rarely call parents, relatives and close friends first. I shift my focus to my works, my small family hundred percent. Now is the time to think about reconnecting with them again.

**Creating products.** I have a ton of ideas about open source projects. But I did nothing. Idea keeps coming. I want to do it. I research about it. I plan to do it. But then my own fears and mental barriers keep holding me back. As a result, no product hasn't been executed yet.

**Reading.** I just read less than 3 books this year. Many books in remaining reading list are waiting for me to clear in 2020.

**Blog writing.** I was failed to keep the discipline on writing too. I was shine to write in English. Maybe my blog post will have a lot of grammar issues. And I keep delay to write new one.

**Photography.** I didn't take enough photos while we were having tremendously moments. I need to record more our happy moments for showing to #nhim later in case we cannot remember.

**Travel.** We didn't travel much both internal and international places. Only visited Dalat.

**Charity work.** Neither I am. No charity work hasn't been done last 2 years.

## 3. What am I working toward?

**Improve my family's health.** We all believe `wealth is nothing without health`. And our top priority is improving our health every single day.

**Continue focusing on building my Saigon team.** I still have bunch of works to do. However, thanks to those works, I have chances to learn countless stuffs too. Now my mission is only accomplished when my team member's and my company's goals are achieved.

**Read more books.** We all know about the benefits of reading books. Me too. This year, my focus topics are: technology (construction, music and medical tech), psychology, meditation and children teaching methodology.

**Write more blog posts.** Yep, beside reading book, writing is my only way to organize, memorize and share my knowledge.

**Take more photos.** I am thinking about buying an used DSLR. Hopefully after reading this blog, my wife will approve my budget request :kissing_heart:.

**Travel more places including both internal and international places.** Travel will be another top priority this decade for us. I want my family will able to learn more about other cultures and perspectives.

**Do more charity works.** Absolutely, after gaining enough income for worrying less about our finance, I think now is the time for me to share with other unlucky people.

### TL;DR

Thanks for reading my blog and Happy New Year 2020! :tada: :fireworks:
