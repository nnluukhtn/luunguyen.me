2020 has been… an interesting year, to say the least. And now it's time for an honest mark-to-market, a moment to look back and analyze what I have achieved vs. my initial plans.

## What a Year

**COVID-19** should be the first word. We all experienced the lockdown, prospects of opening, and then some places starting to be shaky again.

Besides, *The Australian Bushfires*, *BLM*, *The 2020 U.S. Presidential Election* are some other events that just sprang to my mind.

Now let look back at my 2020 with some words.

### Lucky

As far as surviving 2020 goes, I consider myself very lucky. I wasn't laid off or cut the salary. My day-to-day work hasn’t changed much. I feel that I’ve fared better than many others.

Moreover, our company keeps growing, yay :money_with_wings:

Ultimately, [Vietnam’s economy shows positive signs](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/fdi-data-shows-vietnams-steady-economic-growth.html/) thanks to the government :pray:

### Stronger

#### Muay Thai

Got addicted to Muay Thai in 2019 and was learning until Oct 2020 (when I got [injured](#injured)) helps me enhance my self-discipline, unleash my inner warrior. Also, it's my best stress-buster friend.

I also did little pad holder courses with my wife, my teammates which have lots of fun.

#### Chess

Yay again, my blitz rate now is above 1600 since the first day I tried in June 2020.

#### Cycling

Started from the beginning of Dec 2020, the result is not too bad, right? :muscle:

#### Hubble

With new joiners from manager level for eg: [Julius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uyjulius/) our VP of Engineering, or [Simon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonteo/) our Senior Product Manager, things (products and processes) are getting sharp.

I would say I am super happy when seeing the team is growing day to day, both the technical part and the connection. Below are some fun moments we have together.

*am I sure everything is good? Definitely not*

### Injured

Once upon a time, when I was punching with full power to the heavy bag at the wrong angle, resulting as an image below :facepalm:. It almost took 6 weeks to back to normal, and 3-5 months more to back to Muay Thai (which I am waiting for).

*That is pretty much for 2020 though.*

## What's new in 2021?

### Recover

Yes, absolutely, I need to do it right for recovering, make sure my hand is okie to carry heavy things, and back to Muay Thai.

### NEW

#### New blog UI

Actually it was just an update to cover that I didn't have any newer posts so far since the last annually review :see_no_evil:.

#### New outlook

I'm successful on tempting my wife to change her hair color, also her style. Now it's my turn :sweat_smile:. Maybe I will have a new hair color/style or new eyeglasses.

#### New open-source project

It was a year when I delayed contributing to the open-source project. 2021 is the year that I expect to have significant contributions.

#### New direction

Actually, it's not new since 2019, but now my career direction is extremely clearer.

### Delegate

In order to support the [new-direction](#new-direction), somehow I might need to give up on leading by example a bit. It's still good, but to me, delegating, mentoring, managing is much more important to grow the team rather than do them all by myself.

### Improve

#### Chess Improvement

My goal for blitz lichess rating 2021 is **2000+**. Hmm, it seems a bit hard, but let see.

#### Cycling Improvement

Yet another goal, number it at **300km/month**.

#### Leadership

More or less, building, running the team is the focus.

## TL;DR

*2020: Thank you for the lessons.*

**2021: I am ready for something NEW.**

Wishing all a happy, healthy and prosperous 2021!
